Just to learn Github
repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs

Branches - Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.
    The master branch
    A new branch called feature (because we’re doing ‘feature work’ on this branch)
    The journey that feature takes before it’s merged into mastercommits - saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated 
    
Commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. 

Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pull request, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red.

Merge Pull Request - bring your changes together
